## How to use BPM

The use of BPM (Beats Per Minute) in the BUNNY RT Sheet Editor or similar tools serves several important functions:

1. **Synchronization with Music**: BPM provides a tempo reference that allows for precise synchronization of visual elements or notes with the music track. This is crucial for creating accurate and engaging rhythm-based experiences.

2. **Grid Alignment**: BPM helps in setting up a grid that aligns with the beat of the music. This grid is used to place notes or events at exact intervals, making it easier to match the timing of musical elements.

3. **Consistency and Accuracy**: By using BPM, creators can ensure that the timing of notes is consistent throughout the track. This reduces errors and maintains the rhythmic integrity of the composition.

4. **Tempo Adjustments**: BPM allows for easy adjustments of the song's tempo. Tools like the BUNNY RT Sheet Editor often provide options to change the playback speed, which can be useful for practicing or creating variations of the same track.

5. **Visual Feedback**: BPM can also be used to provide visual feedback, such as a metronome or beat markers, which can guide the user in placing notes accurately in relation to the beat.

6. **Snap-to-Grid Functionality**: BPM enables the snap-to-grid feature, where notes or events snap to the nearest beat or subdivision. This makes editing faster and more precise.
